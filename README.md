In order to accelerate the usage of large 3D data over the web, we are developing an open source 3D tile converter called **3DTG**. This tool will convert most textured 3d mesh and point cloud formats into 3D tiles which can be used with the CesiumJS and newly announced “Cesium for Unreal” project to stream massive 3D datasets over the internet.

Cesium 3D tiles are an open spec for streaming large 3D datasets over the internet.
