In order to accelerate the usage of large 3D data over the web, we are developing an open source 3D tile converter called **3DTG**. 
The tool is based on the open 3D Tile standard.

This tool will convert textured 3d mesh and point cloud formats into 3D tiles which can be used with the CesiumJS and newly announced “Cesium for Unreal” project to stream massive 3D datasets over the internet.
